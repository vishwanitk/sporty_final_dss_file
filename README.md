This dataset contains detailed information on over 60,000 Spotify tracks, including track names, artists, popularity scores, release dates, and audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and acousticness.

Our goal? To uncover music trends, analyze listening preferences, and explore what makes a song popular on Spotify.

We started by cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values and formatting release dates to create a structured, reliable dataset.

Next, using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, we explored key insights:

How track popularity correlates with features like danceability and energy.
Which years and artists dominate Spotify’s charts.
Genre-specific trends in song characteristics.
We visualized findings using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

This analysis is valuable for music producers, marketers, and even Spotify playlist curators aiming to understand listener behavior.

As the final step, we applied a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend the 5 best track options for users, based on their preferences in:

Energy
Danceability
Followers of an artist
Year of release
By combining user inputs with machine learning, we provided personalized recommendations, showing how data science can create smarter music discovery experiences.

In essence, this project blends data science with the music industry, demonstrating how data can drive smarter decisions and creativity in today’s digital music era.
